# Export a VRS file to WAV

The `vrs_to_wav` script enables you to create a WAV audio file from a Project Aria VRS recording.
By default, it extracts the audio stream from the VRS file and saves it as a WAV file.
You can also use the `--long_wav` flag to export a long WAV file, combining all audio segments into a continuous file.

:::info vrs_to_wav generates an audio export

This script provides an audio export suitable for various applications, including analysis and playback.
