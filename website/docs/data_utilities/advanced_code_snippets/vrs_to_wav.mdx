# Export a VRS file to WAV file

The `vrs_to_wav` script enables you to create a WAV audio file from a Project Aria VRS recording.
By default, it extracts the audio stream from the VRS file and saves it as a WAV file.

:::info vrs_to_wav generates an audio export as .wav file

# Export a VRS file to Wave64 file

You can also use the `--long_wav` flag to export a long WAV file, combining all audio segments into a continuous file.
The Long Wave feature uses Sony Wave64 Format to overcome the limitations of RIFF/WAVE.
As per https://www.ambisonia.com/Members/mleese/sony_wave64.pdf/

:::info --long_wav triggers long wave 64 format; outputs as .w64 file

This script provides an audio export suitable for various applications, including analysis and playback.
